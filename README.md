# Twitter Sentiment üèù





## General Info
Twitter sentiment analysis refers to the process of analyzing the sentiment of tweets to determine the general attitude or opinion of Twitter users towards a particular topic or entity. This is typically done using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on the words, phrases, and context used in the tweet.

Some common techniques used for Twitter sentiment analysis include:

* Text pre-processing: This involves cleaning and preparing the text data by removing any irrelevant information, such as hashtags, URLs, and special characters, and converting the text to a standard format.

* Sentiment analysis algorithms: These algorithms use machine learning techniques to analyze the text data and classify it as positive, negative, or neutral. Some common algorithms used for sentiment analysis include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forests.
